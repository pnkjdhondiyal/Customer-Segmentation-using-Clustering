This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning (K-Means clustering).
The main goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics, so businesses can better understand customer needs, improve marketing strategies, and enhance decision-making.

Additionally, a Streamlit Dashboard is provided for interactive visualization, including 3D clustering plots.
